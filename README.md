# transac_api

Transac_api is an api interface to the jump_database users, invoice and transaction management.

**Version used:** go 1.20

The project exposes four routes on the port 8000:
- GET `/health`: Writes 200 response - used to check if server is alive
- GET `/users`: Get a list of all users.
- POST `/invoice`: Add invoice for user.
- POST `/transaction`: Handle paid transaction for an invoice.

You can read the [openapi file](./openapi.yaml) for more information.

I did not implement unit tests, or an integration test suite.
